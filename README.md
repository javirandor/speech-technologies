# Speech Techonologies - UPF
## Final Project 2019-2020
#### Javier Rando Ram√≠rez

This repository contains the code used for my final project in Speech Technologies and the explanatory slides.

The goal of the project is adapting CMUSphinx model for non-native Spanish speakers. The dataset used was CORELE, more information can be found here: http://cartago.lllf.uam.es/corele/corpus_es.html.

The obtained accuracy was not the expected probably due to the following limitations:

* A further expansion of the dictionary should be considered.
* The language model wasn't updated
* Data comes from interviews. This data are shorts sentences with interrumptions.
