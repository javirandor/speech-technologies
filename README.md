# Speech Techonologies - UPF
## Final Project 2019-2020
#### Javier Rando Ram√≠rez

This repository contains the code used for my final project in Speech Technologies and the explanatory slides.

The goal of the project is adapting CMUSphinx model for non-native Spanish speakers. The dataset used was CORELE, more information can be found here: http://cartago.lllf.uam.es/corele/corpus_es.html.

The obtained accuracy was not the expected probably due to the following limitations:

* A further expansion of the dictionary should be considered.
* The language model wasn't updated
* Data comes from interviews. This data are shorts sentences with interrumptions.

## Executing the code
It must be done in the order indicated by the name of the files:
1. [Crawler](https://github.com/javirandor/speech-technologies/blob/master/1.%20Crawler.ipynb)
2. [Splitting audio and generating unique transcription](https://github.com/javirandor/speech-technologies/blob/master/2.%20Split%20audio%20and%20generate%20transcription.ipynb)
3. [Transcription Normalization](https://github.com/javirandor/speech-technologies/blob/master/3.%20Transcription%20Normalization.ipynb)
4. [Updating dictionary](https://github.com/javirandor/speech-technologies/blob/master/4.%20Update%20Dictionary.ipynb)
5. [Test models](https://github.com/javirandor/speech-technologies/blob/master/5.%20Test%20models.ipynb) (must be done after adapting the model)

## Adapting the model
This process follows the documentation published by CMUSphinx here(https://cmusphinx.github.io/wiki/tutorialadapt/).

For my specific use case, this was the followed process:
1. Creating a working repository where I placed my training audio files and transcription.
2. Copying the default model to the working repository
```
cp -a <your models folder>/es-es/es-es .
cp -a <your models folder>/es-es/es.dict .
cp -a <your models folder>/es-es/es-es.lm.bin .
```
3. Test
